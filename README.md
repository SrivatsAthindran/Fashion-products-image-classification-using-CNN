# Fashion-products-image-classification-using-CNN
## Project description:
The aim of this project is to utilize the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of fashion products according to their Master category (Accessories, Apparel, Footwear or Personal care). Both the Sequential and the Functional API of Keras has been used to perform the same.

Raw dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small. The dataset used for this project is a processed version of the same.

Only the codes for this project are uploaded to this repository.
